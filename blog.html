            <h2>9.28.2021 (Initial Entry)</h2>
            <p>While completing assignment one, index.html, I had trouble with Git and Github. Pushing commits not only to my developent machine but syncing them to my Github repository was confusing at first because I was under the impression that the repositories were automatically linked. In order to understand this better I used github docs and practiced pushing commits to ensure my files were saving to the repo properly. This assignment introduced me to working with Git/Github and the basic version control etiquette that goes with it. I was already familiar with the introductory formatting in html such as unordered lists and headers. The github docs mentioned earlier and w3schools were the resources that enabled me to complete assignment 1. I used the gitHub doc to learn how to push commits and I used w3schools to learn more html syntax, like an img tag.

            <h2>10.23.2021</h2>
            <p>While completing assignment two, the most challenging aspect was getting the sizing and spacing of the posts right. The dimensions of the images in each post were throughing off my alignment. I wasn't aware that the images were the root of the issue until I double checked my post section's display setting, each posts' margins and each posts' sizing after which I inspected each of the tags contained in the posts' contents and determined the root of the issue. I learned how to use flex and get items to wrap. I also leanred how to add effects when hovering over an element. Youtube was extremely helpful in this assignment, mainly watching walkthroughs and getting a sense for workflows/how to keep complexity down. I had to google how to make an object scale as well as how to justify content to be spaced evenly.
