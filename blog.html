                    <ul>
                        <li>While completing assignment one, index.html, I had trouble with Git and Github. Pushing commits not only to my developent machine but syncing them to my Github repository was confusing at first because I was under the impression that the repositories were automatically linked.</li>
                        <li>In order to understand this better I used https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-git/pushing-commits-to-a-remote-repository and practiced pushing commits to ensure my files were saving to the repo properly. </li>
                        <li>This assignment introduced me to working with Git/Github and the basic version control etiquette that goes with it. I was already familiar with the introductory formatting in html such as unordered lists and headers. </li>
                        <li>The web page linked above, https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_images.asp, and a hello_world.html file of mine were the resources that allowed me to complete assignment 1.</li>
                        <li>I used the GitHub doc to teach myself how to push commits and I used the other two resources to learn more html syntax.</li>
                    </ul>
