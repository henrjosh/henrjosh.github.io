            <h2>9.28.2021 (Initial Entry)</h2>
            <p>While completing assignment one, index.html, I had trouble with Git and Github. Pushing commits not only to my developent machine but syncing them to my Github repository was confusing at first because I was under the impression that the repositories were automatically linked. In order to understand this better I used github docs and practiced pushing commits to ensure my files were saving to the repo properly. This assignment introduced me to working with Git/Github and the basic version control etiquette that goes with it. I was already familiar with the introductory formatting in html such as unordered lists and headers. The github docs mentioned earlier and w3schools were the resources that enabled me to complete assignment 1. I used the gitHub doc to learn how to push commits and I used w3schools to learn more html syntax, like an img tag.
            </p>
    
            <h2>10.23.2021</h2>
            <p>While completing assignment two, the most challenging aspect was getting the sizing and spacing of the posts right. The dimensions of the images in each post were throughing off my alignment. I wasn't aware that the images were the root of the issue until I double checked my post section's display setting, each posts' margins and each posts' sizing after which I inspected each of the tags contained in the posts' contents and determined the root of the issue. I learned how to use flex and get items to wrap. I also leanred how to add effects when hovering over an element. Youtube was extremely helpful in this assignment, mainly watching walkthroughs and getting a sense for workflows/how to keep complexity down. I had to google how to make an object scale as well as how to justify content to be spaced evenly. 
            </p>

            <h2>11.4.2021</h2>
            <p>Assignment 3 was challenging because of the posts filter. Initially I was unable to retrieve the html collections I needed, including the post titles and post divs. I resolved this by taking two html collections given th estructure of the html code, the indices of the titles and divs align. This assignment taught me how to write and implement client side scripts (in JS). I was already familiar with the concepts behind the necessary functions I wrote, as a result of prior c++ experience. An especially useful resource for this assignment was w3schools. There was new JS syntax I needed to learn for this assignmemt, for example ".toLowerCase()" or "window.alert()."
            </p>

            <h2>11.15.2021</h2>
            <p>Assignment 4 challenged me to handle http requests and send approptiate responses. The most difficult part of this porcess, for me personally, was to identify the file being requested and provide it. This was solved simply with "req.url" which allowed me to compare the url to the names of files in the folder. I found I already knew basic javascript and how to manage/navigate directories. I learned how to start a server from my development machine and how to handle http requests. This last weeks lecture code and several yoputube videos proved useful in getting this assigment where it needed to be. Syntax was the main reason for these resources, as well where to place logical operators and statements. Lecture covered the concepts that are implemented b.t.s. of http requests. Specifically, I had to google if the || operator could be used in a case value, it cannot. Also, I had to google for the function res.writeHead()and how to assign values within it. 
            </p>

            <h2>12.1.2021</h2>
            <p>Assignment 5 was diffuclt because it required that I effectively use data from a json file to render html on a live server. This was resolved using handlebars templating and seperating files into layouts and partials. I learned that very little html can be used, in the form of a handlebars template, in order to dynamically render web pages based on specific requests. I was already aware that we would at somepoint seperate the data from the html. The lecture code and knowledge was invaluebale to this assignment, I referenced it while including scripts in index.js and package.json. There is a lot of documentation on the internet, which I also used to find out things like the different ways insertAdjacentHTML can be used and how pre- can be used before defining a script.
