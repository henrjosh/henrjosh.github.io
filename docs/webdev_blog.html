                        <li>While completing assignment one, index.html, I had trouble with Git and Github. Pushing commits not only to my developent machine but syncing them to my Github repository was confusing at first because I was under the impression that the repositories were automatically linked.</li>
                        <li>In order to understand this better I used <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-git/pushing-commits-to-a-remote-repository">github docs</a> and practiced pushing commits to ensure my files were saving to the repo properly. </li>
                        <li>This assignment introduced me to working with Git/Github and the basic version control etiquette that goes with it. I was already familiar with the introductory formatting in html such as unordered lists and headers. </li>
                        <li>The github docs mentioned earlier and <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_images.asp"> w3schools</a> were the resources that enabled me to complete assignment 1.</li>
                        <li>I used the gitHub doc to learn how to push commits and I used w3schools to learn more html syntax, like an img tag.</li>
                    </ul>
